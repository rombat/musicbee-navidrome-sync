# MusicBee to Navidrome Sync (MBNDS)

## üé∂ Preamble

I've been using [MusicBee](https://www.getmusicbee.com/) for more than a decade. That means years of playcounts, ratings, loved tracks and so on.  
When I set up myself a [Navidrome](https://www.navidrome.org/) server, I didn't want to lose all those years of data, so I decided to do something to import them. 
And I actually still use MusicBee, I only use Navidrome when I'm not home, so I wanted to be able to sync my local ratings/playcounts etc from time to time. 
Hence this project. It's probably a niche use case, but who knows, it can be useful to somebody?  



## ü§î Purpose

MusicBee to Navidrome Sync allows you to:
* import MB tracks playcount, ratings, loved tracks, last played date. You can add them to already existing ND data (for a first time sync), or update them occasionally if needed.
* update ND albums/artists playcount and last played date, and generate or update their ratings based only on ND data (see [Notes](#-notes));


## ‚ùî How to use it

1. First, you need MusicBee 3 with its language set as **English** and [Additional Tagging & Reporting Tools](https://getmusicbee.com/addons/plugins/49/additional-tagging-amp-reporting-tools/) plugin installed
2. Once it's done, select **Music** under the Collection menu. Then click on **MusicBee** > **Tools** > **Additional Tagging Tools** > **Library Report**... to export library data  in a CSV
3. Here, you have to select tags that will be exported as headers for your CSV. You need to select **at least** the following ones for MBNDS to work properly: `<File path>`, `<Filename>`, `<Folder>`, `Last Played`, `Play Count`, `Rating`, `Love`, `Skip Count`.
4. Click on **Preview**, MusicBee will scan your entire collection, so it can take some time depending on its size. Once it's done, click on **Export** and name your file `MusicBee_Export.csv`
5. **Shutdown Navidrome properly**. This is mandatory to avoid backing up its database while there's still operations going on on it.
6. Once Navidrome is shut down, backup its database file, `navidrome.db`. Its location is usually in navidrome `/data` folder. You can backup it either by copying it or with sqlite3 CLI if installed (`sqlite3 <path to original file> ".timeout 30000" ".backup <path to backup file>"` for instance). If you back it up by copying, just copy `navidrome.db-shm` or `navidrome.db-wal` too if present, just for precaution.
7. Clone or dl this repository
8. Copy `navidrome.db` and `MusicBee_Export.csv` to its `/data` folder
9. Run the command you want to run (see below), your database file will be updated
10. Once it's done, go back to navidrome `/data` folder where you found `navidrome.db` and overwrite it with the updated one. Remove any remaining `navidrome.db-shm` or `navidrome.db-wal`
11. Restart Navidrome, and that's it !


## ‚å®Ô∏è Commands

All commands must be run this way: `node index.js [command name] [options]`.  
For instance, `node index.js fullSync -h`

### fullSync

Sync playcounts, track ratings, loved tracks and last played date from MusicBee DB to Navidrome DB. Run on tracks first, then update albums and artists accordingly.

#### Available options :

* `-f, --first` : run sync for the first time: **add** MusicBee playcount to Navidrome playcount. If not used, playcount will be updated only if it greater than Navidrome's one (see [Notes](#-notes)). 

### albumsSync

Update all albums playcounts and ratings based on existing Navidrome DB.

### artistsSync

Update all artists playcounts and ratings based on existing Navidrome DB

### Common options

All commands have these options available:
* `-u, --user <user_name>` : choose Navidrome username (by default if not used, the first found user will be used)
* `-v, --verbose` : verbose debugging
* `-h, --help` : display help for command


## üìã Notes

* This is a **one way sync** only, from MusicBee to Navidrome. Can't do the other way.
* A backup of your Navidrome DB is created in `/data` everytime you run a command
* Updates are only applied when they are more favorable (ex: MusicBee rating > Navidrome rating, MusicBee play date > Navidrome play date...)
* Ratings are updated on certain conditions:
  * For tracks: if MusicBee rating is greater than Navidrome rating
  * For albums, if more than half of the album tracks are rated (its rating will be the average of available tracks ratings)
  * For artists, same as album, will be applied only to artists with more than 1 track


## ‚û°Ô∏è What's next ?

* some refactoring
* Maybe build it as a .exe CLI
* Maybe build it as a .exe GUI ?
